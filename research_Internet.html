	<p>The Internet has been extremely important for everyone. However, as a large-scale distributed system without centralized authoritative control, the Internet is so complicated that people cannot accurately map its topology and routing, not to mention understanding and predicting its reactions to various changes potentially conducted by differnt parties in the Internet. Basically, we are curious about the following questions:   </p>
	<p>1) Can we have a (more) complete and accurate AS-level Internet topology? How far are we from a complete and accurate AS-level Internet map? </p>
	<p>2) Which nodes/links are crucial in the Internet map? Definitely the cruciality/significance of a node/link would be different for different parties and in different scenarios. </p>
	<p>3) Can we have a (more) accurate AS-level Internet routing map? We would like to know the exact path between any two end nodes in the Internet. </p>	
	<p>4) Assuming we have had a good Internet routing map, can we predict the Nash Equilibrium of a game in which two players in the Internet try to control routing paths using any techinical or business approaches? </p>
