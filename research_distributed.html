	<p>In a distributed system, logical or physical resources (e.g. computation resources, storage resources) on different servers are connected by networks to provide services for users. These resources can be used by a single user/job or be shared by many users/jobs. A key problem that has to be solved by the operator of a distributed system is how to schedule these resources to achieve its particular operation goal, <i>e.g.</i>, efficiency, performance, fairness, responsiveness, security. I am broadly interested in the resource scheduling problem in various distributed systems, such as edge/cloud computing systems, distributed learning systems, streaming computing systems, and opportunistic networks (vehicle networks). Basically, I am driven by these challenges in the resource scheduling problem. </p>
	<p>1) For a single job with many components, how to place its components and allocate resources to optimize its performance or guarantee its desired performance? The performance might be measured in terms of various metrics, e.g., latency, throughput.</p>
	<p>2) If the resources are shared by a lot of jobs, how to allocate resources to these jobs? Theoretically, it can be formulated as an optimization problem and what we shall do is solving the optimization problem. In practice, we may not be able to have perfect and complete information about the environment. </p>
	<p>3) Sometimes the system needs to migrate components or tasks from their current locations to other locations. How to accomplish the migration without perceptible interruptions?  We may need specialized solutions for different jobs as  general-purpose solutions are usually less efficient.  </p>	
	<p>4) Developing proper pricing mechanisms is an effective way to schedule resources for market efficiency. How to develop pricing mechanisms for different markets? What if some users in the market are malicious? </p>

	<p class="large">2. Improving the Traffic Performance for Applications  in the Internet. </p> 
	<p>It is well-known that current interdomain routing in the Internet is mainly for ISPs' business considerations, and performance is not the first priority when making routing decisions.  As a result, the resulting paths may not be optimal in terms of performance, such as latency, jitter, loss and throughput. Meanwhile, the Internet is a "best effort" network, which means it does not provide any performance guarantee. However, users of most services/applications are performance-senstive, so applications in the Internet do need a kind of end-to-end communication services with optimal performance or with guaranteed performance. </p>
	<p>About two decades ago, researchers proposed the concept of "application-layer routing" or "apllication-layer traffic optimization" (ALTO) and tried to help applications improve their communication performance. At that time, the main concern was how to find a better overlay path and avoid the interference between underlay routing and overlay routing. In recent years, there have been more and more computation/storage resources in the Internet (aka clouds), and more and more applications become computation-intensive. As a result, application-layer traffic optimization does not only involve application-layer routing (which is to make proper decisions on networking resources scheduling for networking performance), but also involves caching (trade storage for better networking performance) and coding (trade computation for better networking performance).  </p>
	<p>We aim to provide Internet-scale end-to-end communication services with soft guarantees for various applications, especially for latency-sensitive applications and the content delivery of VR live streaming.
