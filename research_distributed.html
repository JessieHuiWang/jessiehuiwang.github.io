	<p class="large">Resource Scheduling in Distributed Systems</p> 
	<p>In a distributed system, logical or physical resources (e.g. computation resources, storage resources) on different servers are connected by networks to provide services for users. These resources can be used by a single user/job or be shared by many users/jobs. A key problem that has to be solved by the operator of a distributed system is how to schedule these resources to achieve its particular operation goal, <i>e.g.</i>, efficiency, performance, fairness, responsiveness, security. I am broadly interested in the resource scheduling problem in various distributed systems, such as edge/cloud computing systems, distributed learning systems, streaming computing systems, and opportunistic networks (vehicle networks). Basically, I am driven by these challenges in the resource scheduling problem. </p>
	<p>1) For a single job with many components, how to place its components and allocate resources to optimize its performance or guarantee its desired performance? The performance might be measured in terms of various metrics, e.g., latency, throughput.</p>
	<p>2) If the resources are shared by a lot of jobs, how to allocate resources to these jobs? Theoretically, it can be formulated as an optimization problem and what we shall do is solving the optimization problem. In practice, we may not be able to have perfect and complete information about the environment. </p>
	<p>3) Sometimes the system needs to migrate components or tasks from their current locations to other locations. How to accomplish the migration without perceptible interruptions?  We may need specialized solutions for different jobs as  general-purpose solutions are usually less efficient.  </p>	
	<p>4) Developing proper pricing mechanisms is an effective way to schedule resources for market efficiency. How to develop pricing mechanisms for different markets? What if some users in the market are malicious? </p>
