</ul>

<div style="margin: 0 0 2em 2em">
	<p>There has been evidence that some nations have deployed surveillance systems on core Internet transit links that reside within their borders, which means international traffic flows of other nations which traverse these links to reach their destinations are under the security risk of being analyzed. Definitely this kind of cases will be more prevalent in the future. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the following questions. </p>
	<p>1) In the current Internet routing, how significant is the exposure of its own international traffic flows by routing infrastructure to other nations? Can this nation make all its international traffic flows routing around its adversary nations successfully? </p>
	<p>2) When the international situation becomes tense, every nation will try its best to revise the Internet routing decisions via any techniques and strategies. The final routing of traffic flows is determined by all participants, which means the actions of these nations are interacted with each other. When every nation cannot improve its situation by revising its own actions, a stable Internet would be reached. It is valuable to know the situation of each nation in the routing of the stable Internet. </p>	
	<p>We believe the research efforts of this project will promote research progress of Internet topology and routing inference, and have high significance for understanding and improving the routing security of traffic flows of our nation.</p>
